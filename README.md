FizzBuzz in C#
==
This application is a reproduction of FizzBuzz using C# and Nunit

##Thoughts on this project
As this is my first C# application I found quite interesting using a compiler like Xamarin Studio. The program itself looks more complex than JavaScript and Ruby (which I did before) and I am getting use to the strongly typed functions.
Pair programming was crucial because of the all new environment to set and use.
