FizzBuzz in C#
==
This application is a reproduction of FizzBuzz using C# and NUnit

##Thoughts on this project
As this is my first C# application I found quite interesting using a compiler like Xamarin Studio. The program itself looks more complex than JavaScript and Ruby (which I did before) and I am getting use to the strongly typed functions.
Pair programming was crucial because of the all new environment to set and use.

##How to run it
Clone the repository
```
SSH:
$ git clone git@github.com:matteomanzo/FizzBuzz_Csharp.git
HTTPS:
$ git clone https://github.com/matteomanzo/FizzBuzz_Csharp.git
```
Change into the directory
```
cd FizzBuzz_Csharp/FizzBuzz
```
Compile the program
```
mcs Program.cs FizzBuzz.cs
```
And run it
```
mono Program.exe
```
Run the test by opening the `FizzBuzz.sln` in Xamarin Studio and click on `Run Unit Tests`.
